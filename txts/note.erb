** IMPORTANT **
This program will read/write to local directory <%= Dir.home %>/onagova_saves/hangman

During 'make your guess' prompt -save {name} command can be use to save your game state
EX. '-save foo' (without the quotes) will create a save file at <%= Dir.home %>/onagova_saves/hangman/foo.sv

If you have save files in the above mentioned directory a prompt to load a save file will be shown at the start of the game
